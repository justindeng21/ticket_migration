HELP-16232,HELP-16232,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",mtibbetts@llbean.com,mtibbetts@llbean.com,ben.reppe@crownpeak.com,"Dear Mr Michele Tibbetts,

most of the time while loading the SiteArchitect is consumed within this step:
> 3rd, The Starting application... pop-in displays 'Verifying application' which took 1 minute 16 seconds 

Do you have an open connection to the internet and can the java application use it?
If not, I assume, that the root cause is, that java tries to verify, if the FirstSpirit application has a valid certificate and if it is backlisted. Since the connection to the appropriate servers isn't possible, you have to wait till the timeout is reached.
If my assumption is correct, you can solve this issue by open the java properties (control panel->java) and deactivate the appropriate options on the advanced tab.

Please send me a short feedback, if this solves the issue.

> When I leave the tool idle to work on something else most of the time it will hang for another 2 minutes before reacting to whatever I clicked on.
This is strange, since the SiteArchitect would react to a 20 second break with an connection error, so it shouldn't be a problem with the network or with the FirstSpirit server itself.

Due to your description ('When I leave the tool idle to work on something else') and the screenshot of the resource monitor (80% of memory consumed, 96% disc activity) I assume that windows is swapping, so that the application was transferred from the memory to the hard drive while you was working within another application. When you switched back to the SiteArchitect, it first had to be reloaded to memory (and maybe another application had to be transferred to the hard drive).
If my assumption is correct, the issue should not appear, if a low amount of memory is used. Can you confirm this?

The solution here isn't easy (aside from enlarging the memory or using a SSD for the swap file ;), since it is a standard behavior of windows to move unused applications from memory to the hard drive, if there is a shortage of free memory. If the swapping of windows is the root cause for this issue, please contact your local administrator for a solution.

If you can solve this issue with this general hint, I would be glad to get a feedback :)


Since in both issues I wasn't able to clearly identify the root causes (I just made guesses based on your description), I'm waiting for your feedback, if you was able to solve the issues due to the above hints. If you couldn't solve the issues, please send me a new description of the issues with regard to the information I sent you.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

I can map your description to some very different input components (CMS_INPUT_DOM, FS_LIST, FS_CATALOG, CMS_INPUT_LINK, ...).

for investigating this issue, I need the FirstSpirit version here, too ;)

Furthermore - do you use the SiteArchitect (I assume, that this is the tool) continuously the whole day, or do you [re-]start it sometimes?
If you use it continuously, does the effect vanish, if you close and restart the SiteArchitect?

Background of the question is, that this would point to a memory leak, so that more and more memory is used, till the Java VM drastically slows down. If so, this information together with the used FirstSpirit version would help me to identify, if this problem is already known.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

All of our Mac users were using a default max heap setting ('Memory' dropdown in Connection Settings) of 512MB. I did some testing on Mac with the setting increased to 1536MB and I noticed that the heap settles around 1GB memory usage (compared to about 600MB on Windows), and performance remains good.  All of our Mac SiteArchitect users have 16GB RAM with an i7 processor and SSD, so increasing max heap up to 1536MB is not a big impact to the machine.  I had a user test it for two days and he said “It has been running very smooth since I did the change.'  In addition, the users restart SiteArchitect at least once per day, at the beginning of each day.  I think we can close this issue at this point.

Thank you for contacting Technical Support.  The error is coming from project.setCustomProperties.  Setting a property on a project is a project administrator only function.  So, unfortunately, no object's permissions can be changed to accomplish what you would like to do.  However, you can try to run the module as a (project) administrator, by using a remote project connection, as discussed in the following post in the FirstSpirit Community:

https://community.e-spirit.com/community/developer/blog/2012/11/20/sudo

This should then allow a regular user to run the module without error.  Please let me know if this helps.

We had a defect with Mac OS High Sierra where the internal preview engine was not working.  That was fixed with FirstSpirit 5.2r14.  Is this user the only Mac user on High Sierra experiencing the problem with the internal preview?

The FirstSpirit version containing the fix can be downloaded from here:

URL: http://www.e-spirit.de/download/firstspirit/
user: llbean
pass: lnFS52llbean

The installation files are located under:
5.2.1403/install/

The modules for FirstSpirit 5.2 are located at:
5.2.1403/modules/

If you are not currently able to upgrade FirstSpirit, SiteArchitect can be set up to use the Chrome browser on the user's laptop.  First, disable internal preview by going to the 'Integrated Preview' item in the View menu and uncheck 'use for content'.  Then, you may need to go into Global Settings (gears icon in the left menu bar) -> User Settings.  Once in there, select the Chrome browser for the first 'Browser' field using the icon to the right of that field.  Chrome should be in this path on the machine:

/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome

Please let me know what questions you have.

In reviewing the combined release notes for the latest stable release - 5.2.190406 - there are many significant changes.  The largest of those may be updating Berkeley DB since I believe we are still using v3.



Can you help summarize the steps we will need to do for this upgrade so that we have a feel for how long it will take?",5/14/2019 4:54,ccombar@llbean.com, , , ,1
HELP-41904,HELP-41904,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"Hi Curt,

We can verify which version of the Berkeley DB is being used.  You can find this out by opening ServerManager and going into a project's properties.  Once in there, the last tab on the left should be 'Repository'.  If you click that, you should see a BerkeleyDB version, at the top of the screen in the 'Backend' field.  However, whether it is version 3 or 5, the upgrade to the BerkelyDB can go straight to version 7, without making interim upgrades.  The steps to accomplish the upgrade can be found in the online documentation in the section 'Conversion to Berkeley DB 7':

https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/edocs/admi/firstspirit-ser/project-propert/repository/#ok

To get the BerkeleyUtils.jar file (the utility needed to upgrade the BerkeleyDB), you can download the 5.2.190406 tarball, the version you would like to upgrade to, and extract the file.  It will be in the 'bin' directory.

To obtain the tarball, please use this login:

URL: http://www.e-spirit.de/download/firstspirit/
user: llbean
pass: lnFS52llbean

As you mentioned, this will be a significant upgrade, so it is best to try it first on a development system with a copy of the production project.  Normally the process is smooth, but occasionally we run into upgrade problems.

Which version of Java is being used on the server at the moment?

Is the environment using Tomcat or Jetty for the web server?  If the built in Jetty is being used,  that has also changed and we will need to do further configuration to allow this to keep working correctly as well.

These are the two big things.  Please let me know what other questions you may have after reading the release notes.

Good to know that it is a one-step upgrade to v7.  We plan to upgrade our dev/qa server first and let it operate for a couple weeks before upgrading prod.

Java version reported is Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM version 24.161-b13 (Java version 1.7.0_161-b13)



The web server we are using is 'InternalJetty' so it sounds like we'll need input on the configuration you mentioned.



My only open issue so far then is to come up with an ordered list of upgrade steps, such as:

1) Update Berkeley DB

In general, the process will be as you specified:

1) update Java to JDK 8u192 (Java 8 is needed for the BerkeleyUtil and u192 in the latest version where there were no known issues affecting FirstSpirit)
1) Update the Berkeley DB
2) Update FirstSpirit to 5.2.190406 using ServerMonitoring->Control->Update
3) Configure the web server (if Jetty is being used in production, we should come up with a plan to migrate to tomcat)

I do need to check one thing though to make sure that BerkeleyDB 7 will operate correctly with FirstSpirit 5.2.1204.  I should have an answer sometime tomorrow morning.  If it does not, we would need to add an interim upgrade step.

I have confirmed that there will need to be an interim upgrade step to 5.2 R19-1911, because the BerkeleyDB v7 will not operate correctly with the version currently installed in your environment.  So, the current outline looks like this:

1) update Java to JDK 8u192 (Java 8 is needed for the BerkeleyUtil and u192 in the latest version where there were no known issues affecting FirstSpirit)
2) update FirstSpirit to 5.2 R1911 using ServerMonitoring->Control->Update (check the box to update modules as well)
3) Update the Berkeley DB using the BerkeleyUtils.jar file from the  5.2 R1904-190406 tarball (it is important to use this most recent version of the jar file)
4) Update FirstSpirit to 5.2 R1904-190406 using ServerMonitoring->Control->Update (check the box to update modules as well)
5) Install and configure the tomcat web server (this does not need to be done at the same time and can be done as a separate issue after it has been verified the FS and DB upgrade are stable)
  -there are instructions for installing and integrating tomcat into FirstSpirit in the online documentation (we currently are using tomcat 9 in our cloud      environment, but tomcat 8 can also be used:
   https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/edocs/admi/firstspirit-ser/integration-int/tomcat-servlet/index.html

To give you a little idea of how long the database conversion may take, there were some test runs done by e-Spirit on various configurations to try to approximate various system configurations.  More memory allocated to the process through the command allows the command to run faster (although it is recommended the BerkeleyUtil is configured with the same amount of memory allocated to it as the FirstSpirit server):

• Listing step 8min [20min] - runs were done with 20GB of memory [and 4GB of memory]
◦ Dump / Restore: 11.6h [24.7h]// Verify 9,6h [17,6h]

So, as you can see, it could take up to two days to run the entire process, depending on the size of the databases (I have seen it take longer with some customers).

During the conversion process, 3x the disk space as your current 'repository' directories is needed (data/repository and /data/projects/project_<project_id>/repository).

When the BerkeleyUtils.jar is run, it should be run from outside the FS install directory structure.

Please let me know what questions you have.

Patrick Marquis

I wanted to check back in with you regarding this ticket.  As I was reading through it, I noticed I had provided the link for how to install and integrate Tomcat, but had not included the information on migrating to the new Jetty module.  The migration instructions are in the Release Notes from the 2018-09 release, which I have attached to this ticket.  I'm not sure how the FirstSpirit environment is set up at LL Bean, but the original integrated Jetty allowed for reverse proxy to be used in the environment and the new Jetty module does not.

1) Regarding 'update FirstSpirit to 5.2 R1911 using ServerMonitoring->Control->Update (check the box to update modules as well)', I assume 'modules' refers to our custom modules and that these should be re-built with Java 8u192 and updated here?



2) We thought we should first upgrade to 5.2 R1911 and let it stew for a week to see if it is stable before upgrading to 5.2 R1904-190406, in case we need to back out the 5.2 R1904-190406 so that we don't have to go all the way back to 5.2 1204.  Does that make sense at all?



3) As for the time required to do the database upgrade (wow!), I'm not sure how exactly to measure the current size of our DB, but if the backups are any indication, we are at just under 8GB for backups.



Thanks for the info on Jetty.  We're not using a reverse proxy at all so I assume we'll be OK with the new Jetty.",5/28/2019 12:49,ccombar@llbean.com, , , ,1
HELP-41904,HELP-41904,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"Hi Curt,

No worries!  Regarding your questions:

1) the modules refer to stock and custom modules.  Checking the box will get the standard ones which come with FirstSpirit, but not the custom ones.  Hanako said she has been able to build them against the current version of FirstSpirit and Java 8, so they should be ok (but yes, they will need to be rebuilt)

2) I think that is an excellent idea to upgrade to FS5.2R19 and make sure it is stable for a week or so before moving on with the rest of the process

3) So, it sounds like it may take a while to perform the database upgrade, and that much data allows for the possibility of problems.  That and getting the timing down for when the upgrade is performed on the production server are all reasons for running through this on a development/test server first, which mimics the production server as closely as possible

4) Sounds like it should be ok with the new Jetty module, but it will still be a good idea to make sure that gets tried on the test server as well.

Please let me know what other questions you have.

Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,This just in - I've just been made aware of Oracle's licensing changes and have had some discussions around switching to OpenJDK.  Do you recommend we switch to OpenJDK for our installation as well as for building our custom modules?,5/29/2019 6:19,ccombar@llbean.com, , , ,1
HELP-41904,HELP-41904,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"HI Curt,

With the interim upgrade step of 5.2R19, FirstSpirit support for OpenJDK had not yet been established.  So, for the interim step, it will unfortunately be necessary to upgrade to Oracle's Java 8.  However, for the final upgrade to the most recent version of FirstSpirit, you can use OpenJDK.

Regarding Oracle's JDK 8u212, there were issues that could occur with certain Java settings with 8u201 and 8u202:

https://community.e-spirit.com/community/customer/blog/2019/01/21/warning-problems-with-java-versions-8u201-8u202-and-1102

However, I do not see version 8u212 listed, so that version may be ok.  However, I found an Oracle page where you can download older versions of Java:

https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html?printOnly=1

For the most recent version of FirstSpirit, OpenJDK 8 and 11 are supported:

https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/edocs/admi/technical-requi/compatible-comp/index.html#kompatible_jdks

As an aside, for SiteArchitect, it is recommended that the FirstSpirit Launcher be used with the most recent version of FirstSpirit (this provides its own Java version and does not require that Java be installed on a client system).  The interim step will still require Java on the client system.

Also, I spoke to Andreas, and he thinks it would be a good idea, once you do the final upgrade, to go to the new, isolated version of FirstSpirit, which provides some protection from potential class loading problems in module development.

https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/edocs/mdev/isolated-mode/index-2.html?query=*isolated*

So, we will check that the custom modules are isolated mode compatible.

Thus, we'll stick with 8u192 for this upgrade and look into moving to OpenJDK for a future upgrade.



I read the page you linked on isolated mode.  I get that it splits out the classloaders to prevent conflicts with 3rd-party libraries that might be used by our custom modules.

It turns out it is actually compressed inside of the fs-server.jar file (in server/lib), and gets extracted on install.  I extracted the one from the 5.2.201906 download and have attached it to this ticket.  If you have trouble with that file, you can obtain it from your download by going to the server/lib directory and doing the following:

1) copy fs-server.jar and rename it to fs-server.zip.
2) unzip the file
3) within the unzipped fs-server folder you will see a file: BerkeleyUtil.jar.pack.gz file
4) there is a Java utility called unpack200, which should be on your system with a Java JDK which you can use to unpack this file by running:

unpack200 BerkeleyUtil.jar.pack.gz BerkeleyUtil.jar

Please let me know if you have any problems either with the attached file or extracting it on your server with the above steps

Update of the Windows installation was easy using the .exe in the installation directory.  What is the exact file that I need to use when using the ServerMonitoring web app Control/Update option?  I have tried both firstspirit-isolated-5.2.1911.tar and fs-isolated-server.jar and each time I get:

After discussing this here, I think with 5.2.1911 the update process in ServerMonitoring did not recognize the fs-isolated-server.jar at that time.  I apologize for the confusion.  However, that is ok, because this is an interim step.  We do not need to go to the isolated server until the final upgrade step.  If we choose the fs-server.jar file instead, that will work and be fine for this step.  You mentioned it was easy with the .exe, are you doing this upgrade on the production server or a development server of a different, non-Windows OS?  When you used the .exe, did you upgrade to isolated or non-isolated?

I have run into problems testing going into isolated mode with the Linux tar files with 5.2.201906.  Until I find out what is going on, I think the next step you should take would be to do the upgrade to the regular (non-isolated) version of FirstSpirit 5.2.201906 for now.  So, you can use the same process to upgrade from 5.2.1911 to 5.1.201906, by going to the update page and just selecting the fs-server.jar file from the FS 5.2.201906 tar file.

Once the update completes (based on our past discussions here), I expect you will go the the start page and find a red message that a certain number of project are still using internaljetty (if not, ignore the rest of this paragraph).  To remove that message, open the ServerManager and go to the 'Web server' tab.  You will likely see one Web server listed (internaljetty).  Click the 'Add' button, click to highlight 'Jetty Web Server' and put 'jettymodule' in the 'Name' field and click 'ok'.  Then, click the 'Migrate' button.  You should see a dropdpown box on the left with 'internaljetty' in it.  In the dropdown box on the right, select 'jettymodule'.  Then click 'Next' (it will tell you all the projects which will be migrated) and finally click 'Finish'.  It will take a few minutes, but will eventually complete.  Once you log out and back in the message should be gone.

Sorry for the delay with the isolated server.  We have time to migrate that in a separate step.  I will get back to you once I have figured out the problems I am seeing.

Best Regards,

Patrick Marquis

For our DEV/QA environment on RedHat, I did in fact do the NON isolated mode jar after you had confirmed problems using the server update with the isolated mode jar.  So where we stand at present on our DEV/QA RedHat environment is:



1) 5.2.1911 NON-isolated mode install done

2) All BDBs converted to V7

3) Regression testing done.



So are you saying updating from 5.2.1911 to 5.1.201906 isolated isn't working using server update, similar to the problem we encountered trying to use server update from 5.2.1204 to 5.2.1911 with the isolated jar?

Correct.  There is supposed to be a new process now for upgrading to isolated mode where a tar file is untarred in the FirstSpirit install directory.  However, when I tested this, I ran into problems with the server.  Do you know if the modules were updated to only work with the isolated mode, or if they are also backwards compatible?  If they are backwards compatible they can be deployed with an upgrade to 5.2.201906 non-isolated mode.  If they are not then, for now, leave the original modules in place during the upgrade to 5.2.2019.06.  Or, we could delay the next upgrade until I figure out why the migration to isolated doesn't seem to be working.

I took a look at the fs-wrapper.log content you sent.  It appears the update did not correctly alter wrapper files.

Let's first try to see if just updating the wrapper files will fix the install.  I have attached a tar.gz file which contains the *wrapper*.* files.  Go ahead and untar it and put the *wrapper*.* files in place and then see if FirstSpirit will start at that point.

If it still doesn't work, we can try using the firstspirit-5.2.190606.tar.gz file (which is going to be the new update process going froward now anyway).  With the use of this file, unzip and then untar all except the 'data' directory into the FirstSpirit installation directory.

Just make sure to backup the installation directory before running the upgrades.  Also, please check to make sure the ownership of the files are correct after the update.

Please let me know how these attempts go.

That error looks like there is a Feature Switch (TS_190534) likely set in the fs-server.conf file, which is no longer utilized in the new version of FirstSpirit.  Please take a look either in the file itself or in ServerMonitoring->Configuration->Server.  The line should look something like this:

FEATURE_SWITCH.TS_190534=true

Correct, it would be the former... the feature switch is no longer used in this version of FirstSpirit.  The fs-server.conf file is still used.

Since there is no specific mention of this feature switch in the fs-server.conf file, then it is likely compiled into a web app.  We should rebuild the web apps.  To accomplish this, please do the following:

1) stop the FirstSpirit server
2) go into the FirstSpirit installation directory and and rename the 'web' and 'work' directories to 'web.old' and 'work.old'
3) restart the FisrtSpirit server

The startup will take longer than usual (I have seen it take up to a half an hour before), but the web apps will all get rebuilt.  After the process is complete, you will see new versions of the 'web' and 'work' directories.  This should eliminate any incompatibilities or conflicts which may exist.  After we have confirmed everything is working, the 'web.old' and 'work.old' directories can be deleted.

Please let me know how it goes and what questions you have.

Best Regards,

Patrick Marquis

This could be the result of the new Jetty module.  Has that migration taken place yet?  Take a look in ServerManager at the Project's properties and go to the 'Web Components' tab.  Then, click on the 'ContentCreator' tab.  Is there anything (other than [none]) listed for 'Active web server'.  If not, are you able to click the dropdown box to the left fo the 'Install' button, chose 'jettymodule' and then click the install button?

Actually, I think your initial thought is correct.  I spoke to one of the consultants here, and he believes the 'null' is coming from the name/version of a resource in each of those modules.  Each is returning 'null' or a null string, which results in the perceived conflict.  So, perhaps it would be best to have Hanako take a look at those modules.  Of course, I can still look at the current configuration of the server as well, if you would like.

But then the ContentCreator apps wouldn't deploy on server startup for a similar reason.

Ok, good!  This is apparently a result of the new Jetty module.  The generated files are no longer placed in the 'web' directory.  However, I'm not sure why they are being put in a 'null' directory.  Seems there must be a configuration I am missing somewhere.  I will have to research this and let you know.  Meanwhile, at least we know the files are still being generated and where they are going for now (am I correct that all the generated files are in there, in the individual project id directories).

I think part or most of the current problem is the incomplete migration to the Jetty module.  Are the custom modules now loading/running without error?  If so, we should be able to do the following:

1) open ServerManager
2) go to the 'Server' menu and click 'Properties'
3) go the the 'Modules' tab and expand 'FirstSpirit Jetty Server'
4) click to highlight 'JettyService' and click the 'Start service' button
5)  click the 'Activate Autostart' button
6) close the server properties window by clicking 'OK'
7) double click a project name to open that project's properties
8) click the 'Web components' tab
9) click the 'ContentCreator' tab
10) click the dropdown menu next to the 'Install' button and select 'jettymodule'
11) click the 'Install' button
12) click 'Yes' when it asks if you want to proceed
13) click 'Execute Now' in the next popup

Hopefully it completes by displaying a message that the web application has been installed on the web server 'jettymodule'.  If not, please forward any errors (and click any 'Details' buttons to get the detailed error as well)

If you would like to do a screen share so I can walk you through this, let me know and I will set one up or we can use your web conferencing solution.

Forgot to add, once the web apps for each project successfully installs, you should see the following directories in the /opt/firstspirit5/data/modules/FirstSpirit Jetty Server.JettyService/webapps/:

fs5webedit_100564
fs5webedit_180190

And, when a publish is done, in /opt/firstspirit5/data/modules/FirstSpirit Jetty Server.JettyService/webapps/fs5staging/webapp/ you should see these directories:

It now looks like Jetty is running, and I see the fs5webedit project folders.  The only downside is publishing is still failing but I think it is because of the unfortunate naming of the Jetty folder with *spaces* in the name.  Not unix friendly, especially when I programmatically build a command line like this:



/llbean/batch/firstspirit/bin/publishToCaaS.sh /opt/firstspirit5/data/modules/FirstSpirit Jetty Server.JettyService/webapps/fs5staging/webapp/100564/300073/ caas-qa.gcp.llbean.com AIzaSyAv5ljrDnz33asF55D_SbuP-qtbDWQxcRw



The spaces in 'FirstSpirit Jetty Server.JettyService' break up my command line so that it looks like separate command parameters are being sent.  Let me try to quote these paths.

I noticed that too, about the directory name,  when I saw it.  Unfortunately, I do not think there is a way to rename or change the destination folder. If quotes do not work, is there a way to escape the spaces with a '\'?

I will open a ticket with our development team to find this out if there is a way to change any of this.  My guess is the answer will be no... and this may hasten our need to migrate the environment to tomcat if quotes or escaping do not work.

You mentioned early on that we might also want to switch to Tomcat for the web server.  Can you confirm whether or not the generation path when using Tomcat will have spaces in it?

HELP-41904,HELP-41904,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"Hi Curt,

Unfortunately, as expected, there is no way to change the path of the generation directory with the Jetty module.  I'm not quite sure why this is the case (or why it was designed this way with spaces in the generation path).  I was only told about how to use quotes or escape the spaces.  I spent some time today to see if there was a way to hack it for now, but could not find a way.

Tomcat can be configured.  I believe the default tomcat webapps directory is <tomcat install dir>/webapps (or $CATALINA_HOME/webapps).  But I believe that directory can be changed in tomcat as well.  After tomcat is installed and running, you would add the tomcat web server (in the same place we added the 'jettymodule' web server).  In the configuration for the 'tomcat' web server (FS configuration), there is a field for entering where you configured the location of the tomcat webapp directory.

Here are a couple of sections from the FirstSpirit documentation on configuring tomcat to use with FirstSpirit:

https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/edocs/admi/firstspirit-ser/integration-int/tomcat-servlet/index.html
https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/edocs/admi/firstspirit-ser/server-properti/web-server/index.html

At this point I think I have just two issues.

1) External preview not working.  In Site Architect, the integrated preview is working as expected.  But when you right-click the eye icon in the toolbar to bring up external preview in a browser, I notice that the URL is slightly different than the internal preview URL, mainly that a '/0' is missing from the end of the URL.  When I add the '/0' to the end of the URL in the external browser, the preview functions.  I'm researching this further to see what the cause might be but if you have any insights, I'd like to hear them.

     a) Doesn't work (no preview content is inserted): http://ecwcmq01.llbean.com/fs5preview/preview/100564/page/EN/current/100573/301819/guiLanguage=en/noEvent/sid=4472269928548232877/login.ticket=14ylv79u5kc99

     b) Works (preview content shows as expected): http://ecwcmq01.llbean.com/fs5preview/preview/100564/page/EN/current/100573/301819/guiLanguage=en/noEvent/sid=4472269928548232877/login.ticket=14ylv79u5kc99/0



2) Content Creator isn't working.  When I open it from the start page, it prompts for project, then goes to a blank page. Not sure if there is anything particularly relevant in browser console, but so far I see a 404:

GET http://ecwcmq01.llbean.com/media/loading.gif 404

I'll continue to research this one to see if I can provide more details.

Regarding the ContentCreator, were all projects migrated again to tomcat?  Where is the tomcat webapp directory now?

Sorry, I was on another call.  Yes, you can shut down FS, remove the web apps (save them instead of deleting them for now until we know the new configuration will work) and then start up FS again.  It's basically the same process we went through when we renamed the web directory before.

The only problem I'm having now is that our preview isn't rendering right in Chrome, but preview and content creator seem fine in FireFox, so i'm going to chalk that up to some restriction we're hitting up against in Chrome that is preventing our preview javascript from firing.

As far as Control/update, only a regular internet connection should be necessary (port 80):

I see 3 or 4 of the same stack trace reported, going back to 2016.  So it is not new, but it happens pretty infrequently (that we know of).  Is there a pattern noticed as to what the users are doing in SiteArchitect when the problem happens?  How do they resolve the problem?  Have there been any changes to Windows profiles recently?  Is there anything different about the two users (groups they belong to, different OS on their laptops, etc)?  If they quit SA and remove the C:\Users\spctc\AppData\Local\Temp\FirstSpirit_1564749079478 folder, does the problem still exist?

I have been told that there will be configurable image compression starting with this month's release (2019-09) through the use of the FirstSpirit API.  I do not have much documentation yet, but here is what I was able to find (and translate):

short comment
Automatically generated image files in FirstSpirit can now be configured by the custom project property ImageWriterParams, depending on the resolution and file format. For example, the compression rate of JPEGs can be configured to achieve better image quality or smaller file size when created.

introduction
Automatically influence generated image files in the project
In the 'Media' section (in the SiteArchitect and ContentCreator), the media (pictures, files) of a FirstSpirit project are managed centrally. Media of the type 'image' can be present in different file formats (eg JPEG) and resolutions (eg 72 dpi) in the project. Each image is initially stored unchanged in the project,  in the resolution and in the format in which it was inserted in the media management (resolution 'original').

Certain actions (based on the original image data) automatically generate new FirstSpirit image files, such as:

when creating a preview image
when generating new resolutions
when using an automatically generated resolution
when cropping in the SiteArchitect

This generation can now be influenced by parameters depending on the resolution and depending on the file format.
For example, the compression rate of JPEGs can be configured to achieve better image quality or smaller file size when created. Where:

high compression = small file = low quality
low compression = large file = high quality

Hopefully this helps.  I will keep an eye out for more documentation as this month's release approaches.


Best Regards,

Patrick Marquis

I am not sure about this.  In looking on the Apple Developer site, it seems like the applications which need to be notarized are native XCode apps, but I could be wrong.  Also, I have seen mention that the JRE/JDK may need to be notarized.  I will have to check with the development team and get back to you.

Sorry, I know Catalina was released the other day.  I am still waiting to hear back from the development team regarding this question.  I (and actually all the Mac users in the company as well) am waiting to hear something.

We still haven't rolled out Catalina here but I'm not sure how long they'll hold off on rolling it out. Hopefully FirstSpirit launcher will be fine with the update - fingers crossed!,10/9/2019 5:55,ccombar@llbean.com, , , ,1
HELP-43565,HELP-43565,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"Hi Curt,

Sorry again for the delay.  I received feedback from the development team this morning.  According to them:

1. When updating to Catalina with the launcher already installed, everything should work fine.
2. When installing the launcher in an OOTB-Catalina, Gatekeeper will stop the installer from running.  However, a Gatekeeper workaround exists:
    -> while holding down 'ctrl', click the installer and select open. This will throw up a warning about unnotarized code, which can be ignored by simply selecting open.  Once installed, it will run as expected.

Also, also, apparently another solution would be to go into the macOS settings and start the installer from the Security tab.

Please let me know what questions you have.


Best Regards,

I took a look through our documentation and did not find mention of settings which may be used to help extend a connection timeout.  I will bring it up with my colleagues in Germany to see if they know of any.

Has this problem started or become worse since the upgrade over the summer?  How often is it happening and have there been any noticeable patterns?

There has been some work on checking connection status with ContentCreator.  I will have to find out if there has been any work with SiteArchitect as well.

I have not been able to find any settings which would help this problem.  Additionally, I am told there is no current work in progress regarding this in SA (current connection work is centering on ContentCreator).  What I can do is submit a ticket to the development team, but I would like to include more information when I do.  The next time this happens, could you send me the SA logs (Help->Show log file in File Manager) from the client and also the fs-server.log and fs-cleints.log files from the FS server which cover the period when the connection dropped?

One thing I have found, and recall from when this occasionally happens to me, is that Java sometimes loses its connection to the server if my laptop goes to sleep.  Do you know if this may be happening with users who are reporting this problem?

HELP-44339,HELP-44339,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"Hi Patrick.  I just happen to have had what seem to be very short-lived network hiccups today in the office, where an active Microsoft Teams meeting temporarily loses audio, but open SSH terminals never lose connection. So in other words, less than one second outages.  However, each time this happens, SiteArchitect _immediately_ kicks me out with the lost connection stack trace, even though I was _actively_ working in the tool (not a laptop sleeping scenario). Other users remained in Site Architect no problem during the same time period. So it seems it is not a server-wide thing, rather it's associated with an individual user's connection. 



Regardless, the problem is that it's just too sensitive. It needs to do a better job at trying to recover the connection because kicking someone out of the tool several times a day and having them need to re-open the tool and re-find their workspaces is a big distraction.



Attached is my client log for my most recent issue today, along with a section of the fs-server.log from the same timeframe.  fs-clients.log had no updates since 15 mins before this issue so I didn't include it.



I've also attached some helpful screenshot images.



Thanks for following up with the dev team on this!

Sorry, one more thing.  I thought I would see the server information in the log file, but I don't (because there are no errors or stack traces, just warnings).  Could you go to the FirstSpirit login page in your browser and click the 'Server version' link at the bottom of the page, then click the 'Show all details link' and copy all the FirstSpirit server information, including Java version, that gets displayed?

Still experiencing this problem.  just had it re-occur on my SiteArchitect in Windows 10, running using FS launcher.  Plenty of disk space free.

Sorry to see this is still a problem.  How often is it happening at this point?  If you have not already killed SiteArchitect, could you get three thread dumps before you do and send them to me?

You should be able to get the PID of SA on the command line on a Mac (ps -ef | grep java) and then use it in this command to generate the thread dumps to the current directory:


    jstack [PID from output] > threaddump.txt

jstack comes with the JDK.  Please let me know what questions you have.

Three in a row on the same PID, yes.  It allows us to see if there are any stalled threads as well.  On Windows, you can Launch the task manager by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` and find the Process ID of the SiteArchitect Java process.  If you can't see the PID column right click a column heading in Task Manager and choose PID.  Then you should be able to open the Windows command prompt and run the same command.  Thanks!

After doing more research, I discovered this issue was supposed to have been fixed in an earlier version of FirstSpirit.  However, it could still be seen when an upgrade is performed from an earlier version (such as is the case here).  I am told that that the problem should be able to be resolved by dong the following on the user's systems:

1) Quit SiteArchitect
2) Quit the FirstSpirit Launcher
3) delete Launcher and SA temp files:
a) On Windows, delete
C:\Users\USER_PROFILE*firstspirit*
and
C:\Users\USER_PROFIL\AppData\Local\Temp\FirstSpirit*

b) on a Mac, in the user's home directory delete
~/.firstspirit*

When SiteArchitect re-launches, these directories will get recreated.

Please let me know what questions you have and if the problem is still seen after doing the above steps.

Also, in those same settings, are you able to uncheck 'Use FirstSpirit Launcher' and open SiteArchitect the old way, with Java Web Start, until we figure out the problem with the launcher?

I've been researching this error and it seems it can be caused by a variety of things.  I did  a search and was not able to find that same stack trace reported with the launcher before.  I made several attempts to reproduce with a Windows 10 image I have, but was not able to do so.  Let's see if we can try to do a little narrowing down of the problem in your environment.

1) Is there any way I can get access to the QA server, to see if it happens with me?  Plus, I would have access to server log files

2) Are others seeing the same problem, or just your user on your laptop?

3) Are you able to tell if the same error is seen on a MAc vs Windows laptop?

4) Were there any other changes made to either the server or your laptop around the same time?

Once I know a little more about the scope of the problem (Mac vs Windows, all people vs a subset, etc) I will open a ticket with the core development team.  Also, could you provide me with the server logs at the same time as the stack trace you provided (or reproduce it again and provide me with the client stack trace and server logs at the same time)?  Thanks!

According to the documentation I see, the new image files are supposed to be generated on these triggers:

-generating a preview image
- creating new resolutions
- using an automatically generated resolution
- cropping an image in SiteArchitect

Is that not happening?

Either way, if it needs to be done via script I can do it.  I just need a mechanism for being able to regenerate resolutions without editing each image.

Unfortunately there is no way to force existing images to be regenerated.  Generation only occurs for newly uploaded images.  The options which would be available to *regenerate* existing ones are these:

1) Export the project without the generated resolutions (an option can be activated within the export dialog)
2) Reimport the pictures (a re-upload of the original resolution will invalidate the generated pictures for the other resolutions)
3) There may be a script which was created to help with this.  I will see if I can obtain it if you are interested

Note, each of these solutions will result in a much longer generation time for the next generation, because all image for the used resolutions will be regenerated and this will be done with only *two* threads.  A rough estimate would be about 5 seconds per image that has to be created (but the time is just a guess, since it depends on the size of the images and the power of the server)

Please let me know what questions you have.

I was able to find the repository script.  To use it you have to start the RepositoryViewer:

- Login to the FirstSpirit start page with a user with server admin privileges
- Copy the link for the SiteArchitect
- Put it in the address line of a browser tab and change app=client to app=viewer and open the url
--> the backend tool opens (RepositoryViewer)
- read the warning --> you can destroy the project if you change the wrong content --> then click 'ok, I'll be careful, I promise'
Note: This is a backend tool - so you won't see things like waiting circles, progress bars, etc
- Open the project with Server/Connect remote
- You should see the stores after a bit of time

Once the project loads, call the following menu item:

 ![](https://espirit.zendesk.com/attachments/token/0GJ4QPXEFmjMOCm1ZGkADHG3C/?name=inline-1702548523.png)

In the next dialog you can select a path for the dumpfile (where the deleted types are written out, if you want to dump them at all) => point 1.

 ![](https://espirit.zendesk.com/attachments/token/eREM3SoYxQCTTdjqsmButQM4H/?name=inline-88589461.png)

Then copy the following script code into the 'Script' tab => point 2.

##

import java.util.HashSet;
import de.espirit.firstspirit.store.access.Types;
import de.espirit.storage.BaseTypeFileFilter;
import de.espirit.storage.FileIterationParameters;

/**

context.clearLog();
context.logInfo('Test script');

bytes = 0;

/**

init() {
    context.logInfo('Init');
    context.logInfo('Writing log output to: ' + context.getLogPath());
    if (context.hasOutputFile()) {
        context.logInfo('Writing repository files to: ' + context.getOutputPath());
    }
}

/**
 * Called before a repository iteration starts and before the first file is visited.
 */
start() {
    context.logInfo('Iteration start');
}

/**
 * Called on each file iterated. If the method returns true, the file is added to the statistics panel and the visit
 * method is called on the file.
 */
boolean accept(file) {
    // accept all files
    return true;
}

/**
 * Called on each accepted file. If the method returns true, the iteration is continued. If false is returned, the
 * iteration will end.
 */
boolean visit(file) {

    if (file.getType().toDebugString().startsWith('MEDIA_STORE_CACHED_PICTURE')){
        context.logInfo('Visited file: ' + file.toDebugString());
        context.logInfo('cache type to delete: ' + file.getType().toDebugString());

        if (context.hasOutputFile()) {
            context.writeOutputFileEntry(file);
        }

        context.delete(file);
    }

    files++;
    bytes += file.getSize();
    // continue iteration
    return true;
}

/**
 * Called after a repository iteration is done.
 */
end() {
    context.logInfo('Iteration end');
}

/**
 * Finalization method. Called once after all iteration operations are done.
 */
finish() {
    context.logInfo('Finished, ' + files + ' files, ' + bytes + ' bytes');
}

##

Then click the start button => point 3.

The entire repository will be traversed and _ALL_ types with MEDIA_STORE_CACHED_PICTURE (ie MEDIA_STORE_CACHED_PICTURE and MEDIA_STORE_CACHED_PICTURE_META will be deleted from the repository for all resolutions.

IMPORTANT!!!
The RepositoryViewer manipulates the BerkeleyDB directly and has the potential to completely destroy a project.   Please be careful which types you delete in the repository and test the script thoroughly on a test system with a test project first.
The script has been used before, but cannot be guaranteed with your projects.  Please make sure you have a completely tested backup of the production project before using the script on it.

Please let me know what questions you have.

I'd say asset cleanup coupled with scheduled archiving is probably just what we need.

This question was run up the chain to get an official response.  The result is the FirstSpirit 5.2.191107.78688 SiteArchitect client will be supported with Big Sur, with restrictions.  As e-Spirit is not a part of beta programs with Apple, there will be some limited tests run in the new operating system, once it is released.  According to the core team, only the basic FirstSpirit functions are tested regularly as part of quality assurance and there may be issues with drag-and-drop functions and the integration of native applications, e.g., in the integrated preview.  

I know that Apple has been making privacy changes and I had read about some changes with the JAVA_HOME environment variable, but was there anything in particular you had concerns about?

When you say 'with restrictions', does that just mean that since only basic functions will be tested, there's no guarantee that anything other than basic functions will work?  Or does that mean there are known restrictions/limitations?;

In addition, I am planning for an upgrade to the latest FirstSpirit some time in December, though I need to do the release notes analysis first, to check for any possible impacts to users.

Correct, 'with restrictions'  means there is no guarantee that other than basic functionality may not work.  The areas most likely to be affected are areas which rely on the underlying OS, like the integrated display and drag and drop functionality.  If you (or someone else) finds a defect, an attempt will be made to try to fix it.  However, it is possible it may not be fixable if it is not part of the core functionality.  Also, if fixed, it would be fixed in a new version, not retroactively to an older version of FirstSpirit.  So a FirstSpirit upgrade would be required.

I apologize.  Apparently we do not have any good generic examples, and any implementations may be project specific (at least according to a person I was able to reach today).  It would need to be implemented as another output channel in the project, and I was told that the XML output channel in the Mithras Energy project is an example of an RSS feed, but there are no instructions to go along with it.  If you look at both the PDF and XML output channels, you can see examples of how other output channels can be implemented.  Do you have the Mithras Energy project?  If not I can try to get it to you.  It is large (~700 mb) and not provided for regular download at the moment, as it has not been updated to remove any references to FS_LIST, which is no longer supported. 

Please let me know if you don't have the Mithras (or Mithras 2.0) project and I will see of I can get it to you in a download folder.

Hi Rob,  

    

In such cases, it is always a good idea to reach out to Techsupport (I have set them on CC).   

    

I do not know the specific configuration of your server so that I have to put some guesswork into my response: Some configurations rely on additional services like an external web server that also needs to be restarted. If not configured properly in some cases a restart from the server monitor does not restart those external servers and could cause problems. I do not assume that though. Do you have access to restart those services and maybe the whole server? Just in case the FS restart causes problems as described?   

    

The issue with your preview might also be caused by such a third-party service and might not be a FirstSpirit issue in the first place.   

    

You may want to provide us further information to diagnose the issue and figuring out the best course of action.   

    

What error messages do you/they see?   

    

Best,   

    

Markus

Hi Markus/Bob, 

  

We have an issue right now where the people using First Spirit cannot get the preview to work on Category pages.  I have asked them to restart their instances, they had already done so 4 times, still an issue.   

  

I would usually go to Curt Combar on this, but, he is out this week.  My team taking over coverage has the necessary admin permissions, but, not trained yet.  

  

I see there is a restart for FS, should we consider a restart of the application below?  Or, should I reach out to FS Support at this url:  [https://help.e-spirit.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/6|https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/help.e-spirit.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/6__;!!KOaiBw5s!EdMM2fUVchcJQTAIuFuuavo6WziHi38R_-QodIUoLS5juOZWF-mJiGxCbohGpiM$]

HELP-49973,HELP-49973,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"Hi Curt,

The best way to update the server is using the tar and jar files, correct.  There will be two files needed, the fs-update-[version].tar.gz file and the fs-isolated-server.jar file.  Both should be be found in the update directory where you get your downloads.  Note for the fs-update-[version].tar.gz file, the version number will not be the same as the FirstSpirt version.  For FirstSpirit 2021-01, it is fs-update-1.0.10.tar.gz.  The server should be stopped and the .tar.gz file should first be extracted in the firtstspirit5 directory.  This will update the wrapper environment and a few other files.  Then, the fs-isolated-server.jar file should be placed in the server/lib-isolated directory and the server restarted.  You will need to update the Java path in the fs-wrapper.isolated.conf file before restarting the server.

There is detailed information about this in the online documentation:

 

[https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/edocs/inst/aktualisierung/index-2.html]

[https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/edocs/admi/updating-firsts/updating-firsts/index.html]

[https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/edocs/admi/updating-firsts/manual-update/index.html]

 

Any FirstSpirit modules which are not standard can be found in the 'modules' or 'modules_all' directory where you download the update files.  They should be updated at the same time.  Standard ones will be updated from the fs-isolated-server.jar file.

Both Java 11 and 15 are currently supported at the moment.  Just make sure all of your custom modules, components and extensions are tested with the new Java version.  I would also test the FirstSpirit ones as as well.  I know there has been testing going on with them, but it is always safest to also test in your own environment.

FS_LIST has been removed as of 2021-01, so a check of the template code should be made to ensure to FS_LIST is not being used.  FS_CATALOG, FS_INDEX, and CMS_INPUT_SECTIONLIST are available replacements for FS_LIST, depending on the context.

There is a new ContentCreator look that users will need to get used to.  It is similar, but there will be a small learning curve.  I think most users liked it better when it was first introduced early last year.

I believe you are already using the launcher.  That is now the method for opening Site Architect and Server Manager.

Please let me know what questions you have.

Have a good weekend!

According to our documentation, we strongly recommend using Apache Tomcat version 9.0.31 (or higher). This is because of security concerns due to critical bugs in previous Apache Tomcat versions.  So, I would recommend that it be updated.  Since it appears this is a recommendation due to security vulnerabilities and not fictionality, If you are not overly concerned (given your particular environmental setup), I suppose you could postpone it for bit, until you are sure the new FirstSpirit and Java versions are working correctly, without changing too many things at the same time.  But it should be upgraded as soon as possible after that.  If this is going to be tested for a few weeks in a test environment, I would say you could postpone the Apache Tomcat upgrade in the test environment for a few weeks, but then upgrade it and test further, for another week, before finally pushing to production.  I hope this helps.

HELP-49973,HELP-49973,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"Hi Curt,

The only thing that jumps out at me here is the I/O error.  I assume it is coming from tomcat.  Is 100564 the project ID of one of the current projects (you can find that in the list of projects in ServerManager)?  Is this error coming up when you attempt to build the ContentCreator web application in ServerManager or did you just find this information in the fs-server.log or tomcat log file?

If this error is not occurring when you attempt to build the ContentCreator web application, let's try to build it.  Go into ServerManager and double click to open the project with ID 100564.  Then, click on 'Web Components' in the left column and then the 'ContentCreator' tab.  Make sure there are no components listed in red.  If there are, click on them and then click the 'Update' button at the bottom of the window (not the one at the top).  Once all components are listed in black, click the 'Update' button at the top of the window.  If there is no 'Update' button, click the 'Install' button.  Once the build completes, try to go into ContentCreator for that project.

If this does not resolve the problem (or the error occurs when you were attempting to build the ContentCreator web app), shut down FirstSpirit and rename the 'web' and 'work' directories in the FirstSpirit root directory to 'web.old' and 'work.old'.  Then restart FirstSpirit.  It will take longer to start up this time, because it will be rebuilding all the web applications in the 'web' directory and redeploying them.  You may want to restart tomcat once FirstSpirit completes its startup and has rebuilt all of the web apps (it should also redeploy them to tomcat at that point).

Please let me know if any of this helps to resolve the problem.

Is it just that page?  If so, is there anything different about that page that may help us determine what is failing?  Also, its possible the server referred to could be tomcat.  Is there anything in the tomcat logs and has tomcat been restarted since the web and work directories were recreated?

Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"So the problem with the class missing appears to be because WebEdit/Content Creator for the project hadn't been properly deployed to Tomcat yet.  It was still showing Jetty.  So I attempted to deploy it, but it fails (see screenshot):

The stack trace from Tomcat below with the root cause being 'Filter mapping specifies an unknown filter name [WebeditAuthentication]'.  The only place I find this 'WebeditAuthentication' reference is in our LLB_LinkReporting module in the web.xml, which hasn't changed in a few years:

--------------------------------------------
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<web-app version='2.4' xmlns='http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee' xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'

        <url-pattern>/link-report/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
</web-app>

We haven't changed our Tomcat server either so I'm not sure why it's complaining about this filter.  Continuing to dig on it...

HELP-49973,HELP-49973,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"Hi Curt,

I looked in our documentation and through past tickets and I could not find reference to a WebeditAuthentication filter.  I then spoke to a developer here to get a better idea of where the WebeditAuthentication filter may be defined.  She was not sure, but in comparing to some of our standard modules, it appears it could just be a function in the fsm.    Given the screen shot you sent, and what you mentioned, I'm guessing it should defined somewhere in the 'LLB_LinkReporting for ContentCreator' module.  Do you see mention of it in there?  Did that module rebuild cleanly?  I'm assuming it did.  If you go into the project's configuration in ServerManager, could to go to the 'Project components' tab, click to highlight the module/component and then click the 'Configure' button.  Are there any configurations here that are missing or incorrect?

If everything still seems correctly configured, can you try re-installing the fsm for that module again at the server level (Server->Properties->modules) by highlighting the module, clicking the install button and re-uploading the fsm file.  Then, in the project's properties, make sure any configurations are correct (save a screen shot of the configurations before re-installing the module), go back into web components->ContentCreator, highlight the module and click the 'Update' button at the bottom of the window.  Once that update is complete, try to install the ContentCreator WebApp (the 'Install' button at the top of the window).

At this point, given that nothing with these modules changed, I am assuming a configuration problem.  One other thing we can do is ensure the error is coming from the LLB_LinkReporting for ContentCreator module is to remove it from the web component and see if it builds then.  That should at least verify the problem is definitely in that module and not a reference from somewhere else.

Let me know the results. 

Best,

HELP-49973,HELP-49973,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"Thanks Patrick.  So it looks like the problem is that we are referencing a servlet filter 'WebeditAuthentication' that is no longer defined.  I checked the deployed directory of our production project on our production server, which is still running 5.2.1911 and sure enough, the generated file under <apache root>/webapps/fs5webedit_100564/WEB-INF/web.xml  has this filter defined:

        <filter>
                <filter-name>WebeditAuthentication</filter-name>
                <filter-class>de.espirit.firstspirit.webedit.server.io.WebeditAuthentication</filter-class>
        </filter>

in addition to several e-Spirit-generated <filter-mapping> references to it.

In the 5.2.2101 generated web.xml, this <filter> is no longer defined, and additionally, there are no longer any references to it in the generated web.xml. In fact, there only <filter-mapping> in the new generated web.xml, besides ours, is this:

        <filter-mapping>
                <filter-name>BrowserCachingFilter</filter-name>
                <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
                <dispatcher>FORWARD</dispatcher>
        </filter-mapping>

So it looks like the custom code that was generated for us 5 years ago added our /link-report/ functionality to Content Creator, which involved adding this filter-mapping.  Perhaps the mapping is no longer needed?   I'll continue to experiment with it, but if you could do some checking with the dev team to see if anyone recalls this changing, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks!

The ticket does unfortunately not provide any useful information. Please add some appropriately :)

After looking into the referenced Helpdesk Ticket we also need the Tomcat configuration files. The mentioned WebeditAuthentication filter is now registered dynamically and is therefore no longer hardcoded in the web.xml. The customer's Tomcat version 9.0.22 should be able to run the application properly, like our own installations and test setups do.

I apologize, for some reason my description did not get saved into this ticket during the sync from the help desk ticket.

To re-add the description:

LLBean is updating our FirstSpirit installation from 2019-11 to the latest version, 2021-01

They have run into an exception while trying to build the ContentCreator web application, they ran onto an exception seen below which indicates there is an unknown filter being referenced called WebeditAuthentication.

They have a custom module which does reference this filter in the web.xml:

--------------------------------------------
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<web-app version='2.4' xmlns='http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee' xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
xsi:schemaLocation='http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd'>

<filter-mapping>
<filter-name>WebeditAuthentication</filter-name>
<url-pattern>/link-report/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
</web-app>
--------------------------------------------

comparing to the production sever, which is still in FS 5.2.1911, the generated file under <apache root>/webapps/fs5webedit_100564/WEB-INF/web.xml has this filter defined:

<filter>
<filter-name>WebeditAuthentication</filter-name>
<filter-class>de.espirit.firstspirit.webedit.server.io.WebeditAuthentication</filter-class>
</filter>

in addition to several e-Spirit-generated <filter-mapping> references to it.

In the 5.2.2101 generated web.xml, this <filter> is no longer defined, and additionally, there are no longer any references to it in the generated web.xml. In fact, there only <filter-mapping> in the new generated web.xml, besides ours, is this:

<filter-mapping>
<filter-name>BrowserCachingFilter</filter-name>
<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
<dispatcher>FORWARD</dispatcher>
</filter-mapping>

So it looks like the custom code that was generated for us 5 years ago added their /link-report/ functionality to Content Creator, which involved adding this filter-mapping.

I have been grepping around in a FS 2021-02 installation, I found a WebeditAuthentication.class file inside the webedit-1.31.jar file.  This file should be compiled into the ContentCreator web application (fs5webedit_100564) in the /WEB-INF/lib directory.  Is your version of the webedit jar file also 1.31 and if you copy that file to /tmp and extract its contents, do you see the WebeditAutherntication.class file within it?

Also, in Googling dynamically loaded classes in tomcat, I found some articles/posts about dynamically including classes:

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15066935/how-to-dynamically-load-a-class-on-tomcat]
[https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html]

I'm wondering if this class now needs to be included in the LL Bean Link Report module, since that appears to be what calls for it?

So my understanding of a servlet filter is that it's configured in the web.xml (with the <filter-mapping> tag) to to process requests to the specified URI (link_report in this case).  Somewhere you also need to have the definition of the <filter> that points to the physical Java class implementing the filter.  

I could manually add it to the web.xml for the LinkReporting module, if need be, but something tells me there is a different way to do things now with the new ContentCreator?

The customer uses a module which is operating on a specific implementation detail of the ContentCreator application. This was never an API, and is therefore not something a module can rely on.

The authentication filter has been reworked to work properly with Spring Boot, which the new ContentCreator operates on. Any reference to the previous authentication filter name 'WebeditAuthentication' is now invalid and prevents the web application from being started. The module needs to be fixed regarding this issue.

All of the *Authentication filters are used internally and were never intended to be silently used by custom module implementations. Plugins, Executables and Scripts will get a proper BaseContext they can operate on in the context of the user.

I heard back from the development team.  Apparently the link report module is utilizing a feature of the ContentCreator which is not an external API.  According to the development team:

'The authentication filter has been reworked to work properly with Spring Boot, which the new ContentCreator operates on. Any reference to the previous authentication filter name 'WebeditAuthentication' is now invalid and prevents the web application from being started.

Was the link report module developed by the e-Spirirt Professional Services team or someone at LL Bean (in which case you would have the code for the module)?  I assume you would like some assistance from the Professional services team here to fix this?  If so I will start that process going.  If not also let me know.

As I dig deeper, I have several modules that complain 'An error occurred while installing the FSM file!' when I deploy them, with a log that shows one or more WARN messages about a 'Duplicate detected for resource' that seems to refer to two or more modules that have a dependency on the same 3rd-party jar.  

Since the modules bundle that jar in their fsm file, it's flagged as a duplicate when I deploy any module that references that 3rd-party jar.  For example, our 'LLB_Workflow' and 'LLB_Common' modules both reference annotations-17.0.0.jar in their module-isolated.xml files:

    <resources>
        <resource scope='server' mode='isolated'>lib/LLB_Workflow-21.1.0.jar</resource>
        <resource scope='module' mode='isolated'>lib/annotations-17.0.0.jar</resource>
    </resources>

And the error dialog upon deploy has WARNs like this:

WARN  26.02.2021 10:51:33.384 (de.espirit.firstspirit.server.module.ModuleHandlerImpl): Detected conflict for resource 'lib/annotations-17.0.0.jar' between modules 'LLB_Workflow' and 'LLB_Common'. - Duplicate detected for resource 'null [ISOLATED]' in module 'LLB_Workflow', conflicting resource is 'null [ISOLATED]' of module 'LLB_Common'!

I'm sure it's something simple like I need to change the module-isolated.xml perhaps, but so far I haven't been able to figure it out. I'm digging into the docs to refresh on how these should be configured.  I think it's something to do with switching to isolated mode perhaps.  Any advice you or the devs could give would be appreciated.  Thanks!

Curt

I'm still working through some ClassNotFound errors but it appears these may be related to the Java update from 1.8 to 1.15.

Here's a question - it appears now that we are running in isolated mode, the module.xml files are no longer read and that it only uses the module-isolated.xml files.  Can I remove the module.xml files safely now considering we will stay in isolated mode from  now on?

I'm glad you were able to find the reason for most of the deploy errors at the moment.  I took a look through our standard modules and all still have both the module.xml and module-isolated.xml files.  Also, in looking at the documentation, the module.xml looks to still be used as a fallback, so I would not remove them at this time, even though the server will be running only in isolated mode:

Thanks for the update.  I will keep this ticket in a 'waiting' state.  You will get a couple automated emails from the system and it will automatically be marked as solved and then closed after 10 days.  If you need more assistance, you can re-open it before it closes by adding a comment.  If it goes beyond the 10 days, you will not be able to re-open it (and I won't be notified of any updates to it).  In that case, just open a new ticket and refer to this one in the comments (https://help.e-spirit.com/browse/HELP-49973).

HELP-50561,HELP-50561,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",Rob Jarmusz,rjarmusz@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"Hi Rob,

If the user is in the same Active Directory groups and the groups have been successfully synced to where ever the user is working and the FirstSpirit server(s), that user should have the same permissions.  Does the user have to log in through the browser or are they automatically logged in, based on their user that they logged into their laptop with?  If it's an auto login process, have them try a manual login.  Also, have them try a different laptop (if possible in the wfh era at the moment).  If they are logging in with a VPN, could VPN access be playing a role?

We should be able to see in FirstSpirit which groups the user is in.  Log into FirstSpirit in the browser as an  admin and then click on 'ServerMonitoring'. Then, on the left side, go to User->Search.  Enter the user's name and click 'Submit'.  Then, click on the user's name to find out which groups and projects (all projects including any master projects, etc) they are in on that server.  Compare all the information to one of the other users that has all the correct permissions.  Also, in addition to searching for the user's name, I would scroll through the list of all users to make sure there isn't a typo or two versions of the user's username in the list.  Also, make sure the user is logging in with the correct name (for example the user is logging in as 'sjimenez' and not 'sjimenez@llbean.com' or something like that).

Please let me know what you find.

You can specify the location of the truststore where the certificate is located in the connection settings (accessible from the page after you log in).

To access the connection settings go to the start page-> settings menu in the upper right corner-> connection settings and enter the following in the 'Optional parameters' section:


javax.net.ssl.trustStore = / path / to / file / fs-keystore.jks

javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword = password

 

The truststore needs to be accessible from the local computer where SA is installed.

Please let me know if this helps.

I think basically that file just needs to be transferred to the media folder on the target server, correct?  Any new and released file should get generated automatically.  Transfer would normally take place in a publish job in the ServerManager->Schedule Management.  How are files being moved to the staging site (sftp, webDav, rsync)?  If the PDF is in a new folder in the media store, maybe the new folder needs to be added?  Are there errors or is the file just being skipped?  

Best,

HELP-52546,HELP-52546,,"L.L. Bean, Inc.",ccombar@llbean.com,ccombar@llbean.com,marquis@e-spirit.com,"I just figured it out. The PDF file and the folder it is in are both released, yet nothing was showing up in the generate log or in the generate output folder.  

When I looked at the settings for the generate step in our publish schedule entry, I was reminded that we do a Partial Generation, specifying specific folders in our site structure store.  Images must be generated because they are referenced by content that is in turn referenced by the specified site structure.  But this PDF file isn't referenced in any content, so it doesn't get picked up.  

I just tried explicitly adding the 'PDF_downloads' folder to the list of partial generation folders (see screenshot), ran our publishs schedule entry, and it generated as expected.  Thanks Patrick!

Curt
